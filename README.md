# Dice-Challenge

This is a simple Dice Challenge Game using Javascript & The Document Object Model (DOM). This was a challenge problem provided by Angela Yu on her online Udemy Web Development Course. Once you are able to clone this project onto your workspace and open up using your code editor, you will have access to the Game. By simply refreshing the screen each time the dices will spin randomly for both Player 1 & Player 2. Player with the highest dice roll wins.
